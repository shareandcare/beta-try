									<h2>Sharing</h2>																		
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									Share your online streaming services by listing them on Share &amp; Care to save on monthly streaming subscription costs.</br></br>
									With a few simple clicks, fill out a quick form that asks about your video or music streaming subscription, the plan type and the number of active users.</br></br>
									We’ll review your streaming account, guide you through the next steps and tell you how much you can earn.</br></br>
									Once reviewed and approved, your streaming account is listed on Share &amp; Care, so you can offer streaming content at the best value.</br></br>

									
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									We will notify you when someone requests to join your shared streaming plan.</br></br>
									Our job is to facilitate the onboarding process and ensure you, the ‘sharer’, properly and securely set up the ‘carer’ on your account.</br></br>
									You get paid monthly for all users that Share &amp; Care sets up on any of your streaming subscriptions. The monthly cost for each user decreases as more people join, with the maximum allowed dependent on the streaming service.</br></br>
									Our team will reach out and work with you to address any changes or updates to ‘carers’.</br></br>
									
									Similarly, you are expected to communicate important account changes and updates so we or the ‘carer’ can adjust accordingly.</br></br>
									Aside from that, there is nothing else for you to do except sit back, relax, stream some movies or listen to music as you get rewarded for your kindness!
									</p>

									<h2 class="align-right">Caring</h2>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>Get all the streaming content you want at a fraction of the cost when you join through Share &amp; Care.</br></br>
									When you request to join a shared streaming plan, we’ll ask a few questions about you, gather payment information and tell you the subscription details.</br></br>
									We work with the account ‘sharer’ and manage the onboarding process so you can start streaming as quickly as possible.</br></br>
																	
									Though Share &amp; Care’s mission is to deliver to everyone the most content at the best value, we understand if you no longer require a particular service or simply don’t want to pay for one. We will work with you to have your profile removed from the shared streaming plan and stop recurring payments.</br></br>
									As part of our agreement, deactivation will occur after one additional month of paid service from the time of cancellation request. We believe this is sufficient time for other users on the shared plan to make adjustments accordingly for a potential increase in the monthly price due to your departure. In the future, we hope to reduce the deactivation period and accommodate our users in a more timely manner.</br></br>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/avatar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									Everybody is responsible for their actions and we trust you’ll care for the accounts as if they were your own. This means accessing only your profile and limiting usage to yourself.</br></br>
									Improper and unauthorized use of streaming services will result in discontinuation of services and is subject to an expedited deactivation payment.</br></br>
									Share &amp; Care is built on honesty and we believe our users value their happiness, security and comfort as much as those willing to share their streaming accounts.
